# RAT-by-kellevs-J_AFF
RAT that works with ngrok to Remote the PC from other person by Kellevs and J_AFF 
Change the "HERE THE NGROK TCP" and "HERE THE PORT" with the tcp and Port.
You have to install ngrok to do that.
When you in ngrok you have to type "ngrok tcp 12345" because in the server Script the Host and Port is "127.0.0.1 and 12345"
ngrok will give you the Tcp and Port.
